# Mobile-Computing-3

Project built to run on android mobile device. In this project we make predictions on parts of handwritten images.
We capture the image on the master device and break the image into 4 qudrants and offload it to 4 salve mobiles. 
We have used MNIST dataset and neural networks to train and make predictions. 
On these devices we make predictions on parts of the image and send the predictions to the master device and store the image locally on the mobile device.
